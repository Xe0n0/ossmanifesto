title: OSS Manifesto
---

We are people who want to support and sustain open source software.

We value:

* Respect
* Collaboration
* Healthy debates

We believe that all projects should:

* Have a README file
* Have a Contributing file
* List all core team members in the README file
* Have a License file
* Have a Changelog
* Follow Semantic Versioning
* Tag all major releases
* Provide documentation
